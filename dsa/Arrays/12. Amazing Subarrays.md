# Amazing Subarrays

## Problem Statement

You are given a string S, and you have to find all the amazing substrings of S.

An amazing Substring is one that starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

Input

Only argument given is string S.
Output

Return a single integer X mod 10003, here X is the number of Amazing Substrings in given the string.
Constraints

1 <= length(S) <= 1e6
S can have special characters
Example

Input
ABEC

Output
6

Explanation
Amazing substrings of given string are : 1. A 2. AB 3. ABE 4. ABEC 5. E 6. EC
here number of substrings are 6 and 6 % 10003 = 6.

## Solution

### Approach 1: bruteforce

1. as the substring composed of start index and end index
2. Caliculate for each substring how many substrings start with vowel.

#### TimeComplexity: O(n^2)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)

### Approach 2: using carryforward

1. maintain how many vowels we have encounterd so far -- as they will be the possible starting points for out answer.
2. for each index i, number of substrings that can be formed having vowel as starting character is number of vowels + (1 (if current index is also vowel))

#### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int solve(String A) {
        int  n=A.length();
        int vowels=0;
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            char s=A.charAt(i);
            if(s=='a' || s=='e' || s=='i' || s=='o' || s=='u' || s=='A' || s=='E' || s=='O' || s=='U' || s=='I'){
                vowels++;

                count+=vowels;
            }else{
                count+=vowels;
            }

        }
        return count%10003;
    }
}


```

#### TimeComplexity: O(n);

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)
