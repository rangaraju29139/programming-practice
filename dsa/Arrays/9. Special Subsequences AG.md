# Special Subsequences "AG"

## Prerequisite topics to learn : carry-forward.

## Problem Description

You have given a string A having Uppercase English letters.

You have to find how many times subsequence "AG" is there in the given string.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109 + 7 as the answer can be very large.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= length(A) <= 105

## Input Format

First and only argument is a string A.

## Output Format

Return an integer denoting the answer.

## Example Input

Input 1:

A = "ABCGAG"
Input 2:

A = "GAB"

Example Output
Output 1:

3
Output 2:

0

### Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Subsequence "AG" is 3 times in given string

### Explanation 2:

There is no subsequence "AG" in the given string.

## Solution:

### Approach 1: bruteforce

1. for each A in a given index, caliculate number of G 's that are present in the right of the array

#### TimeComplexity : O(n^2)

#### Space Complexity: O(1);

### Approach 2: using carryForward

1. maintain how many A's present from current index in a integer.
2. if current value is G, Add the number of A's from 0 to i to the result.

code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int solve(String A) {
        int n=A.length();
        int countA=0;
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(A.charAt(i)=='A'){
                countA++;
            }else if(A.charAt(i)=='G'){
                count+=countA;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

}

```

#### TimeComplexity : O(n)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)
