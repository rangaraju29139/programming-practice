# Even Subarrays

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array A.

Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of even length such that the first and last element of all subarrays will be even.

Return "YES" if it is possible; otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes).

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A|, A[i] <= 106

Input Format
The first and the only input argument is an integer array, A.

Output Format
Return a string "YES" or "NO" denoting the answer.

Example Input
Input 1:

A = [2, 4, 8, 6]
Input 2:

A = [2, 4, 8, 7, 6]

Example Output
Output 1:

"YES"
Output 2:

"NO"

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

We can divide A into [2, 4] and [8, 6].
Explanation 2:

There is no way to divide the array into even length subarrays.

## Solution:

### Approach 1: bruteforce

1. as each subarray has the starting and ending index , for all possible start and end index of even length , check if start and end index are even

#### Timecomplexity: O(n^2)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)

### Approach 2:

1. from the observations

   1. if you want to split the array into even length subarray's the input array must be of even length
   2. as each array start and end with even number implies the starting the ending of the ending of input array must be even numbers.

2. if the above condtions satisfy , return yes else no

#### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String solve(int[] A) {
        int n=A.length;
        int start=0;
        int end=n-1;
        if(A[0]%2==0 && A[n-1]%2==0 && n%2==0){
            return "YES";

        }else{
            return "NO";
        }

    }
}

```

#### TimeComplexity: O(n)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)
