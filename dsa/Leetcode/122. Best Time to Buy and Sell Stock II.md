# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## problem statement

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 \* 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Solution

### Approach 1:

1. maintaint the leftMin value but once you sell the particular stock the next left min will be the i+1 value
2. caliculate the profitOrLoss at every index if it is >0 and add the profitOrLoss to the result if it > 0

#### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n=prices.length;
        int result = 0;
        int leftMin=prices[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            int profitOrLoss = prices[i]-leftMin;
            if(profitOrLoss > 0){
                result = result+profitOrLoss;
               if(i<n-1) leftMin=prices[i+1];
            }
            leftMin = Math.min(leftMin,prices[i]);
        }
        return result;

    }
}

```

#### TimeComplexity: O(n)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)

### Approach 2:

1. by the intution we pick the stock at day1 as **we the data of how stock behave tommorrow**
2. if the next day stock is increasing we will wait for stock to increase further
3. if the next day the stock price is decreasing then we sell it today to make either some or 0 profit.

#### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n=prices.length;
        int result =0;
        int startIndex =0;
        int i=0;
        while(i<n){
            int profitOrLoss=0;
            while(i<n-1 && prices[i]<prices[i+1]){
                i++;
            }
            if(i<n){
                profitOrLoss = prices[i]-prices[startIndex];
                result+=profitOrLoss;
                if(i<n-1){
                     startIndex=i+1;
                }
                i++;
            }

        }
        return result;

    }
}

```
