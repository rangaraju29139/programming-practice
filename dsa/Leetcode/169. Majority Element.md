# 169. Majority Element

## Problem Description

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 \* 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution:

### Approach 1: BruteForce

1. for each element caliculate the frequency , if the frequency is > n/2 return the element as majorityElement

#### TimeComplexity: O(n^2)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(1)

### Approach 2: using the frequency HashMap

1. build the frequency HashMap, if at any instance we got the frequency greater than n/2 return that element as the majorityElement

#### TimeComplexity: O(n)

#### SpaceComplexity: O(n)

### Approach 3: using the war approach , when two soldiers fight both will die and remaining majority will the winners.

#### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] A) {
        int n=A.length;
        int majorityElement =A[0];
        int freq=1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(freq==0){
                majorityElement=A[i];
                freq++;
            }else if(A[i]==majorityElement){
                freq++;
            }else if(A[i]!=majorityElement){
                freq--;
            }
        }
        return majorityElement;

    }
}

```
